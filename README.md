# ❤️ Namaste-React 🙏  
**BiteBuddy** is a Swiggy-like application developed as part of the **Namaste React** course by Akshay Saini, Founder of NamasteDev. This app was built from scratch using **React.js** and **Parcel.js**.

### 🚀 About the App
BiteBuddy allows users to browse a variety of food options, similar to Swiggy, and offers features like menu listing and restaurant details, making it an ideal project to practice and implement React.js concepts.

### 🚧 CORS Issue Fix
To resolve the CORS issue while using the Swiggy API, users must install a CORS extension. Follow the steps below to enable CORS for this application.

### 🎨 Project Structure
- **index.html** - Root HTML file of the project.
- **index.css** - CSS file for styling.
- **App.js** - Main JavaScript file for the application.
- **.env.example** - Environment variables for development setup.

### 🔧 CORS Extension Installation
1. Install the **CORS Extension**:
   - Click here to install: [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en).
   - Click on the "Add to Chrome" button.

2. Enable the **CORS Extension**:
   - After installation, click the extension icon in your Chrome browser.
   - Toggle it on and refresh the page.

3. Test the Application:

4. Disable the **CORS Extension** after use (optional but recommended for security).
